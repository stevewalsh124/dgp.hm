    abstract = {We present the BACCO project, a simulation framework specially designed to provide highly-accurate predictions for the distribution of mass, galaxies, and gas as a function of cosmological parameters. In this paper, we describe our main suite of gravity-only simulations (\$L\\sim 2\\,\$ Gpc and 43203 particles) and present various validation tests. Using a cosmology-rescaling technique, we predict the non-linear mass power spectrum over the redshift range 0 \&lt; z \&lt; 1.5 and over scales \$10^\{-2\} \\lt k/(\\, h\\, \{\\rm Mpc\}^\{-1\}) \\lt 5\$ for 800 points in an eight-dimensional cosmological parameter space. For an efficient interpolation of the results, we build an emulator and compare its predictions against several widely-used methods. Over the whole range of scales considered, we expect our predictions to be accurate at the \$2\{\{\\ \\rm per\\ cent\}\}\$ level for parameters in the minimal Lambda cold dark matter model and to \$3\{\{\\ \\rm per\\ cent\}\}\$ when extended to dynamical dark energy and massive neutrinos. We make our emulator publicly available under http://www.dipc.org/bacco},

 abstract={An increasing number of time-consuming simulators exhibit a complex noise structure that depends on the inputs. For conducting studies with limited budgets of evaluations, new surrogate methods are required in order to simultaneously model the mean and variance fields. To this end, we present the hetGP package, implementing many recent advances in Gaussian process modeling with input-dependent noise. First, we describe a simple, yet efficient, joint modeling framework that relies on replication for both speed and accuracy. Then we tackle the issue of data acquisition leveraging replication and exploration in a sequential manner for various goals, such as for obtaining a globally accurate model, for optimization, or for contour finding. Reproducible illustrations are provided throughout.},

We present a new Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for performing inference in models with multivariate Gaussian priors. Its key properties are: 1) it has simple, generic code applicable to many models, 2) it has no free parameters, 3) it works well for a variety of Gaussian process based models. These properties make our method ideal for use while model building, removing the need to spend time deriving and tuning updates for more complex algorithms.}

abstract = {We perform an ensemble of N-body simulations with 20483 particles for 101 flat wCDM cosmological models sampled based on a maximin distance sliced Latin hypercube design. By using the halo catalogs extracted at multiple redshifts in the range of z = [0,1.48], we develop Dark Emulator, which enables fast and accurate computations of the halo mass function, halo–matter cross-correlation, and halo autocorrelation as a function of halo masses, redshift, separations, and cosmological models based on principal component analysis and Gaussian process regression for the large-dimensional input and output data vector. We assess the performance of the emulator using a validation set of N-body simulations that are not used in training the emulator. We show that, for typical halos hosting CMASS galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the emulator predicts the halo–matter cross-correlation, relevant for galaxy–galaxy weak lensing, with an accuracy better than 2% and the halo autocorrelation, relevant for galaxy clustering correlation, with an accuracy better than 4%. We give several demonstrations of the emulator. It can be used to study properties of halo mass density profiles such as the concentration–mass relation and splashback radius for different cosmologies. The emulator outputs can be combined with an analytical prescription of halo–galaxy connection, such as the halo occupation distribution at the equation level, instead of using the mock catalogs to make accurate predictions of galaxy clustering statistics, such as galaxy–galaxy weak lensing and the projected correlation function for any model within the wCDM cosmologies, in a few CPU seconds.}
