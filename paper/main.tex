\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{itemize}
    \item Introduce the cosmology application - why is it important?  What type of data do we have?  What do we want to do with it?
    \item Review what has been done (Mira Titan, cosmic EMU, process convolutions)
    \item Overview our contribution (two-fold, see below) and describe the layout of the manuscript
    \item Our contribution is in the synthesis of hierarchical modeling, DGPs, PCs.
    \item Provide the link to the github repository where all our codes are provided.
\end{itemize}

\section{The data}

Example reference: \citep{damianou2013deep}

Here, we provide further details on the form of the data (in the introduction, we only briefly introduce it).  Include a figure of the raw data for a particular cosmology.  We describe the different modeling components and the regions of the space where they are trusted.  We also describe how each cosmology is a simulation based on 8 inputs, and the output $\mathcal{P}(k)$ is functional.

We will handle the data in two stages.  First, we will focus on an individual cosmology and obtain the best predicted curve.  Second, we will use these curves to predict the curve for a held-out cosmology.  These two stages form the main two sections of this paper.

    \item Example cosmology showing 16 low res, 1 high res, 1 pert, wt avg, and where each output is deemed unbiased
\end{itemize}

\section{Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling for Particular Cosmologies}

The main purpose of this section is to describe our first contribution: the use of a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate the true curve (and provide UQ) for a particular cosmology.  We focus solely on one cosmology, independent of the others.

\subsection{Gaussian Process Model}

Here, we introduce the Bayesian GP model.  We mention the tapering and the formulation of the block covariance matrix.  As well as the posterior conditioning that provides the closed-form solution for the posterior mean and variance.  We can cite Steve's dissertation.

\subsection{Deep Gaussian Process Model}

Here, we expand on the previous section by incorporating a latent layer warping.  We discuss the elliptical slice sampling of $W$, but otherwise it is plugged in to the methods of the previous section with very few changes.

\subsection{Simulation Study}

Here, we can provide results from a sim study comparing the GP and DGP, in which case the true curve is known.

\subsection{Actual results (but more aptly named)}

Estimate one cosmology with 50,000 runs, and use this as a starting point for each of the others
Here we can provide figures of the predicted mean and variances for a subset of the actual cosmologies.

Images:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Illustration of DGP fit (post mean and UQ, could show cosmicEMU as well?)
    \item estimated warping (or, how all 111 warpings compare)
\end{itemize}


\section{Prediction for new cosmologies}

This section details our second contribution - the use of the Bayesian DGP model of the previous section to predict the curve for held-out cosmologies.

\subsection{The model}

Here we describe the PCA-GP model.  We discuss how we use the predicted curves that we got previously as training data.

\begin{itemize}
    \item show breakdown of estimated mean trend, basis functions/PCs, and weights of a particular PC/BF.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Actual results (but more aptly named)}

Here we show results on held-out cosmologies.  We compare to cosmicEMU and Jared's convolution approach. We can also discuss estimation of main effects, interactions amongst the 8 parameters, and variance decomposition.

\begin{itemize}
    \item compare the 4 with boxplot: our DGP training, DGP testing, vs proc conv training (aka Jared's files), proc conv testing (aka Cosmic EMU)
    \item compare the 4's RMSEs as a function of $k$
    \item Main effects
\end{itemize}

\section{Discussion}

Brief recap, directions for future research.

\section{Appendix}
