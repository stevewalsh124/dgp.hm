Annie's comments upon first glance

* If we can't post the real data, can we make a folder called "toy_data" or something and post made-up data that is basically in the same format for testing purposes (don't need 111 files, but atleast some)
* Save things to csv if possible (avoid RData files as much as you can)
* can use "sq_dist" function from deepgp package to avoid plgp package altogether
* do we even need the Vecchia implementation?  If we never use it, I say we ditch it
